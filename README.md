uarm-in-gazebo
==============
We are planning to create a working model of the uarm in gazebo. The uarm is a open-source robotic arm which was created by uFactory and founded through Kickstarter https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ufactory/uarm-put-a-miniature-industrial-robot-arm-on-your.

Our plan (3. and 4. are bonuses if we have enough time):

1. Create a urdf-file from the CAD-model of the uarm and possibly merge or remove some parts to optimize it for the simulation.
2. Create plugins to control the arm.
3. Add a endeffector to the arm.
4. Connect the arm to ROS.

Installation
==============

1. Clone this repository.
2. Go into the directory "uarm-in-gazebo"
3. mkdir build && cd build
4. cmake ../src/
5. make


Usage
==============
After the installation you can start the simulation with the following command:
```
launch_simulation.bash
```
or
```
launch_simulation.zsh
```

Now you can use `uarm_pub` to send commands to the uarm. It's possible to send an angle in radian to a specific joint:
```
build/uarm_pub joint_name angle
```
Controllable joints are *left_base_shoulder_joint*, *left_base_arm_joint* and *center_table_mount*.
Alternatively you can give the `uarm_pub` a specific pose that the uarm should take:
```
build/uarm_pub pose
```
At the moment the only available pose is *home_pose* which gives all three joints the angle 0.

Also you can start another world simulation where you can attach or dettach a small box with a suction cup.
Therefor you have to execute the following command (out of the uarm directory):
```
launch_simulation_with_box.bash
```
or
```
launch_simulation_with_box.zsh
```
Now you have to navigate the suction cup over the box. You can use the following commands (out of the uarm directory):
```
build/uarm_pub "left_base_shoulder_joint" -0.6
```
and
```
build/uarm_pub "left_base_arm_joint" -0.9
```
The suction cup should be over the box now. To attach the box to the suction cup, you can use the following command:
```
build/uarm_pub "attach" 1
```
After you attached the box it is possible to move the arm like described above and the box should be at the suction cup all time.
If you want to dettach the box, you have to use the following command:
```
build/uarm_pub "attach" 0
```
